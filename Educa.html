        <h2><em>Grundskolan</em></h2>
        <p><em>Primary and lower secondary education covers children aged 6 to 15 or grades 1 to 10. Local authorities are required to offer before and after-school care for pupils in 1st to 4th grade. In 2016, 444,638 pupils were in primary education, with a further 184,637 at the lower secondary level.</em></p>

        <h2><em>Primary and lower secondary education</em></h2>
        <p><em>Upper secondary education normally provides three years of general education or four years of vocational training after the compulsory 10-year programme. The norm for apprenticeship training is two years of vocational training in upper secondary education followed by one or two years of practical training in industry.

In 2016, 200,731 pupils were in upper secondary education, with 42,683 in an apprenticeship or vocational training programme. Of pupils taking vocational education, the biggest proportion (28%) were in healthcare, childhood and youth development, followed by (15%) technical and industrial production.</em></p>

<h2><em>Upper secondary education</em></h2>
<p><em>Tertiary vocational programmes are post-secondary, but are not defined as higher education. They run from between six months to a maximum of two years. In 2016, 14,748 students were enrolled in public or private post-secondary vocational education.

Of those, the most popular (45%) fields were natural sciences, vocational and technical subjects. The second most popular field, and the most popular among women, were health, welfare and sport.</em></p>

<h2><em>Higher education</em></h2>
            
<p><em>As of 2016, 288,989 Norwegians were in higher education, of which just under half were attending a university. Tuition at public universities in Norway is free, even for international students.

The percentage of people aged 19-24 in higher education has risen substantially, from around 10-12% in 1980 to 28% (men) and 43% (women) in 2016. The most popular fields are currently natural sciences, vocational and technical subjects (19.5%) followed by education (18%).<br><br>

Some Norwegian students choose to study at universities abroad. Of the 15,762 studying abroad in 2016, the most popular destination was the United Kingdom, followed by Denmark, United States, Poland and Hungary. 
 The Norway higher education system is based on a model that offers standard academic education at the bachelor, master and doctoral levels, as well as professional education programs which are fixed programs of study conferring specific professional qualification. Higher education builds on the successful completion of three years of upper secondary school. The national higher education system is in conformity with the Bologna process, with bachelor's degrees (first cycle, three years), master's degrees (second cycle, two years) and doctoral degrees (third cycle, three years).<br><br>

Educational Institutions in Norway
The Norway Higher Education consists of 8 Universities, 8 Specialised University Institutions and 2 University Centres, 18 State university colleges, 2 National institutes of the arts, 8 Private Colleges with institutional accreditation, and 8 Private colleges with accredited programs and courses.</em></p>
