        <p><strong>Norwegians have developed some traditions, manners and institutions that appear rather baffling to outsiders at first (and sometimes, let’s face it, after a good long while as well). Here are 11 of Norway’s unique customs</strong></p>
        <h2><em>Going all out for Norwegian Constitution Day</em></h2>
        <p><i>Move over US, not even the July 4 rivals the enthusiasm and commitment of Norwegians celebrating their National Day. Many don their bunads, enjoy a champagne breakfast, and then head to the town centre to watch a tear-inducingly cute parade of local schoolchildren waving flags and banners. In Oslo, this takes place in front of the royal family at the castle. The tradition then dictates spending the rest of the day in revelry consuming lots of alcohol and inhaling as many hot-dog sausages, ice lollies, waffles and pieces of cake as possible.</i></p>

        <h2><em>TParty hard for a month… just before your exams</em></h2>
        <p><i>Foreign fans of the SKAM cult TV series may already know that Norwegian high-school students are crazy about buses. In Olso and Bergen’s more prosperous neighbourhoods students group together to buy a bus, bling it up in their final year and drive it around while partying during their graduation celebrations. Graduating students also wear the same pair of red dungarees during the entire month of festivities and are not supposed to wash them. The whole thing climaxes on Norwegian Constitution Day, when the red russe-students often walk in the parade looking suspiciously worn out.</i></p>

<h2><em>Eating brown cheese on waffles</em></h2>
<p><em>Brown cheese is a Norwegian institution in itself. Made with cow’s or goat’s milk, whey, and cream, the cheese has a soft, sticky consistency and tastes almost caramelized. To become a fully fledged Norwegian, try this unusual-yet-delicious topping on a soft waffle.</em></p>

<h2><em>Taco: the national dish</em></h2>
            
<p><i>Like brown cheese, the humble taco has become a bit of a culinary institution in Norwegian culture (top tip: don’t try to mix the two) to the extent that someone has created a history of the taco in Norway webpage. The taco became a regular Friday-night guest in Norwegian homes in the 1990s. Now, the consensus seems to be the more tacos, the better. Its nearest rival is the ‘Grandiosa’, a brand of frozen pizza. In the interests of full disclosure, ‘taco’ in Norway also includes tortillas for some reason.</i></p>
